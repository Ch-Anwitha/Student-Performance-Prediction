# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts a student’s final academic performance using machine learning techniques.  
The model analyzes academic and lifestyle factors such as study hours, attendance, previous scores, and sleep hours to estimate the final score.

The project is implemented using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**, making it easy to visualize data and understand model behavior.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

| Feature Name      | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| study_hours       | Daily hours spent studying           |
| attendance        | Attendance percentage                |
| previous_score    | Previous academic score              |
| sleep_hours       | Average hours of sleep per day        |
| final_score       | Final academic score (Target)         |

The dataset is either manually created or can be replaced with a real-world dataset.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm
**Linear Regression**

Chosen because:
- The target variable (final_score) is continuous
- It is simple and interpretable
- Suitable for beginners and academic projects

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

These metrics help evaluate how accurately the model predicts student performance.

---

## 📈 Results
The model successfully predicts student scores with reasonable accuracy.  
Visualization of actual vs predicted values shows a strong correlation, indicating good model performance.

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in education to predict student performance.  
It highlights the importance of factors like study time, attendance, and previous academic history in determining outcomes.
